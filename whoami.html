		<title>Who Am I?</title>
		
		<h1 style="font-family:'Courier New'; text-align: center;">WHO AM I?</h1>
		
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><u><b>I am a mortal being.</b></u></p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">I was born in the country of England in 2005 and given the name Rahim Ali.</p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Uuuh and I guess that's it, the fact I'm from England is pretty cringe I think.</p>
		<br>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><u><b>I am a programmer.</b></u></p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Mainly I like to program since I'm in love with computers. <s>(Sorry ladies and gentlemen.)</s></p>
		
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Previously I worked on all the code for my game jam game called Lotsa Bots, which you can play here.<br><a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/853609">Lotsa Bots</a></p>
		
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">I also helped a bunch with the programming of my friend's pico day game "Pico Untamed" which you can also play here.<br><a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/883247">Pico Untamed</a></p>
		
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">If you want a programmer slave I would gladly collab, I just need to be paid in uhhhhh, art, your friendship, <s>love</s>.</p>
		<br>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><u><b>I am an artist.</b></u></p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">I draw sometimes, it's extremely rare but I can do that, and I like doing it. I just barely have the strength to do anything nowadays sad face.</p>
		
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Back in the day I would mostly do pixel art but only more recently in my adult years I've been trying to draw the normal way.</p>
		
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Heres some links to some art I've done.</p>

		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">I have drawn a lot more stuff, most of it is just not published anywhere.</p>
		<br>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><u><b>I am a musician.</b></u></p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">This is also one of those things I barely do, hell everything on this page I can barely get to doing <s>(I am severely depressed! :D)</s>.</p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">I do really enjoy when I'm making music though, music is one of my most favourite things in life (I listen to the whole Nine inch Nails discography nearly every day).</p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">I am a part of a game modding group called CoaXioN, <s>(I thought of the name and everything, sunglasses.)</s> and it has a website, which I made music for.</p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">You can check it out at <a href="https://coaxion.games">https://coaxion.games</a></p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">I also make random joke songs, but only post them in private discord servers.</p>
		<br>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><u><b>I am a 3D Animator.</b></u></p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">This is currently one of my most refined skills I have I think.</p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">So back to CoaXioN, I am one of the main developers of the mod Deathmatch Classic: Refragged where I am mainly there for animating the weapon viewmodels.</p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">I also do alot of general cleaning up and random garbage, even small code changes and additions because I'm just like that (I programmed a whole weapon viewbob customization system just because).</p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Here is a work in progress shotgun firing animation I made.</p>

		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">I've done a lot more, but like everything they aren't really published anywhere.</p>
